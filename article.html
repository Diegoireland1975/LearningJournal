        <h3 class="about-me-article-title">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
          simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
        <p>My problem is that I am not consistent in the studying as I should. Recently I lost motivation and I often
          have the feeling to go backwards instead of making progress</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="about-me-article-title">How I got started</h3>
        <p>I started doing a course in Dublin Ireland where i live. First with a short 10 week course where I learned
          the basic of HTML and CSS and some design</p>
        <p>I liked it so i decided to go further and I did a full year in the same College, where I learned both Design
          and Developing</p>
        <p>I dropped out of the college because In my opinion there was too much theory and I countinued to study online
